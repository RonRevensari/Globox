GloBox Food & Drinks Banner Project:

Overview:

GloBox is a delivery company aiming to optimize its revenue streams. This project investigates the potential profitability of introducing a new food & drinks banner on its platform.

Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to assess whether incorporating a new food & drinks banner on the landing page of GloBox's delivery app will lead to increased revenue.

Methodology:

The project utilized an A/B testing approach to compare the performance of two groups:

Control Group: Users who were shown the regular landing page without the new banner.
Treatment Group: Users who were shown the landing page with the new food & drinks banner.

Data Analysis:

Population: The project randomly assigned 48,943 visitors to either the control or treatment group.
Duration: The A/B test was conducted over a two-week period, from January 25, 2023, to February 6, 2023.
Metrics: Success was measured by comparing the conversion rate and average amount spent for each group.

Results:

The treatment group exhibited a 0.71% increase in conversion rate compared to the control group, indicating a potential impact of the new banner.
However, there was no significant difference in the average amount spent between the two groups.
Conclusion
Based on the analysis, it is recommended to launch the new food & drinks banner to all users despite the minor impact on the average amount spent per user. Further monitoring and analysis are advised to assess the long-term effectiveness of the banner.
